## The Idea

An experiment to create a new, simpler, more featureful, but extensible CSL. 

1. Dramatically simplify the citation and bibliography template language and put more logic in extensible and contextual parameter groups, so that processors, styles and UIs are easier to develop, maintain, and use.
2. Do so in a single codebase that provides a single source of truth reference implementation, _and_ auto-generates and (where relevant) publishes:
   - Documentation
   - JSON schemas
   - NPM module(s)
   - Code for other languages (Rust, Haskell, Lua, etc.)

From the beginning, it is designed to add new features even while simplifying the model; notably:

1. multilingual
2. different citations modes

## Details

### Contents and Status

The code here is a `typescript` project that:

1. defines a model that is programatically-converted to `JSON Schema` files, and
   can from there generate different language code via
   [quicktype](https://quicktype.io).
2. provides a proof-of-concept processor implementation.

A first draft of the model is almost complete, while the second currently just reads and serializes data and styles.

### Schema-backed Editing

Here is `VSCode`, with schema-backed validation and auto-completion of a YAML style.

### Deno, Tasks

I am using here `Deno` rather than `Nodejs`. 
It includes:

 - a `typescript` compiler
 - linter
 - formatter
 - test runner
 - bundler
 - benchmarker
 - LSP server
 - simple and high-performace [key-value storage](https://deno.com/manual/runtime/kv), with both local and distributed options

... and all of it is integrated and _very_ fast. 

`Deno` also allows compiling a codebase to a [single self-contained executable](https://deno.com/manual@v1.33.2/tools/compiler) that includes the runtime.

I have a few tasks setup, including to auto-generate an `NPM` module.

<dl>
  <dt>npm</dt>
  <dd>Generate the <code>NPM</code> module.</dd>
  <dt>schemas</dt>
  <dd>Generate the <code>JSON</code> schemas.</dd>
  <dt>docs</dt>
  <dd>Generate the documentation, which outputs to the docs directory, and can be browsed locally.</dd>
  <dt>json</dt>
  <dd>Converts the </code>YAML</code> example(s) to <code>JSON</code>.</dd>
</dl>

### Code Generation from Schemas

To convert the schemas to other languages, try this (in this case Rust):

```console
$ npm install -g quicktype
$ quicktype schemas/csl-style-schema.json -o style.rs
```

Note that the generated code will include a model definition, that should mostly
match the typescript model, _and_ serialization and deserialization code.

Hereâ€™s some minimal rust code to deserialize and serialize the JSON example
style file to Rust Style struct, with result `APA`:

```rust
fn main() {
   let json = fs::read_to_string("src/style.csl.json")
       .expect("Unable to read file");
   let style: Style = serde_json::from_str(&json).unwrap();
   println!("{}", serde_json::to_string(&style.title).unwrap());
}
```

Feel free to experiment with your language of choice and report your experience!

## FAQ

### Why?

At a high level CSL 1.0 is an XML DSL that sets some context-dependent parameters and provides templates for inline and block formatting of lists (citations and bibliographies respectively).

But it has two limitations.

First, the template model is pretty complex, and so difficult for users and developers alike.

Second, it has no method for extension, so any change in behavior requires changes in the XML model, and often, by extension, the styles, and the input schema. 
Given the diversity of software implementations and thousands of styles, and the fact that much of the labor to maintain all this comes from time-strapped individuals, the lack of extensibility enforces a large degree of inertia that we need to address.

This is one idea on how we might do that, then.

### Why the name?

It's a placeholder to call it something, without suggesting any particular future.

### What could that future be?

1. It may be the basis for CSL 2.0.
2. It may inform a path to iterate CSL 1.0.
3. Nothing at all.

### Why `typescript`?

1. It's an elegant way to define a model, that can be converted to different output targets, including `JSON schema` (for other language targets, see [quicktype](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype)).
2. I _hate_ hand authoring `JSON schema`, even in `YAML`.
3. It's widely supported in the `JS` world, and `JS` widely supported more generally.
4. Because the [djot](https://djot.net/) reference implementation uses it, I'd like to take advantage of that.
5. There are two good `EDTF` JavaScript libraries for date validation and formatting.
6. It might be possible to incorporate some code from [citeproc-js](https://github.com/Juris-M/citeproc-js)?

### Why `JSON Schema`? What happened to `XML`?

1. `JSON` (and `YAML`) is more broadly supported today.
2. No decisions on whether or not `XML`, actually, but this is a test to see how much simpler the model can be, and ensure it maps well to standard programming languages (the first implementation of CSL was in XSLT!).
3. It should be feasible to do both (though not clear the effort is worth it).

### Why isn't more functional code here now?

I am:

1. a `typescript` newbie, and an amateur programmer without much experience with it or `Javascript`.
2. pretty good at modeling these sorts of data, with strong domain knowledge, so that's what I started with.
3. didn't want to waste time going down a private rabbit hole without a broader interest check, and opportunity for collaboration.
