# this is a flatter model, relying more heavily on parameters
title: APA
citation:
  # in CSL 1.0, we have this global, but it's specific to citations
  placement: inline
  # There's only so many ways to sort and group, so let's just itemize them
  sort: cs-author-year
  groupBy: cs-author-year
  # again: another example where there are only a few options
  groupAffix: parentheses # maybe would need localizing though?
  # andAs is a property of lists, in this case the citation
  andAs: term
  delimiter: semi-colon
  contexts:
    - integral:
        # maybe a little dicey, but to keep format simpler
        groupAffixLevel: secondary
        # here we override andAs for this mode
        andAs: symbol
        delimiter: comma
  format:
    # in this example, no need for conditional here
    # configure delimiters in parameters
    # author-date styles are such a hassle at this level!
