	 *
	 *    [cite:see @Tarski-1965 chapter 1, for an example]
	 *
	 * "chapter 1" is the locator.  The whole citation is rendered as
	 *
	 *    (see Tarski 1965, chap. 1 for an example)
	 *
	 * in the default CSL style.
	 *
	 * The locator starts with a locator term listed in the LocatorTerms type.
	 * The locator term is followed by a space and then the locator value.
	 * The locator value is a string of numbers and/or letters.
	 * The locator value may be discontinuous, in which case it is separated by commas. For example, "23, 25-36"
	 * is a discontinuous locator value.
	 *
	 * The part of the suffix before the locator is appended to reference's prefix.
	 * If no locator term is used, but a number is present, then "page" is assumed.
	 *
	 * Adapted from org-mode.
